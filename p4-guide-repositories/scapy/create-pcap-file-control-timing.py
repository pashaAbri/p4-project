# If you use tcpreplay, and AVOID giving any command line options that
# control the packet sending rate, e.g. --pps, then tcpreplay will try
# to send the packets spaced out in time in a way that is at least
# close to the relative time stamp files recorded in the pcap file.

# Example tcpreplay command line that can send the contents of a pcap
# file to a specified interface (example 'veth0' below) with
# inter-packet spacing similar to those in the pcap file:

# sudo tcpreplay --preload-pcap -i veth0 pkts.pcap

from scapy.all import *

f = PcapWriter('pkts.pcap')
#print("type(f)=%s" % (type(f)))
#print("dir(f)=%s" % (dir(f)))
