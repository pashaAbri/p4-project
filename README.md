# Utilizing P4-Guide Repositories

## Overview
This document outlines how to use the jafingerhut/p4-guide GitHub resources for assessing the impact of coding assistants and generative AI tools on P4 programming and network security.

## Repositories and Their Uses

### 1. Demo Programs (`demo1` to `demo7`)
- **Purpose**: Analyze standard P4 coding patterns.
- **Method**: Run these programs and compare their structure and function with AI-generated P4 code.

### 2. Scapy (`scapy`)
- **Purpose**: Create and analyze network packets.
- **Method**: Develop scenarios to test the robustness of AI-generated P4 code against security threats.

### 3. PSA Examples (`psa-examples`)
- **Purpose**: Understand complex switch configurations.
- **Method**: Review examples for insights into potential vulnerabilities introduced by AI tools.

### 4. Packet Classification (`packet-classification`)
- **Purpose**: Benchmark AI tool outputs.
- **Method**: Use classification algorithms as a security effectiveness measure for AI-generated code.

### 5. TCP Options Parser (`tcp-options-parser`)
- **Purpose**: Study network protocol handling.
- **Method**: Compare AI tool outputs against standard implementations for vulnerability assessment.

### 6. CRC Calculations (`crc`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure data integrity.
- **Method**: Study CRC implementations in P4 and their AI-generated counterparts.

### 7. Data Plane Writable State (`data-plane-writable-per-table-entry-state`)
- **Purpose**: Explore data plane state manipulations.
- **Method**: Assess how AI tools handle state changes in P4 programming.
