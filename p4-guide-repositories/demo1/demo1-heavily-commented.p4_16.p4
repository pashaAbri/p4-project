 *
 * The standard P4_16 architecture called PSA (Portable Switch
 * Architecture) version 1.1 was published on November 22, 2018 here:
 *
 * https://p4.org/specs/
 *
 * P4_16 programs written for the PSA architecture should include the
 * file psa.p4 instead of v1model.p4, and several parts of the program
 * after that would use different extern objects and functions than
 * this example program shows.
 *
 * In the v1model.p4 architecture, ingress consists of these things,
 * programmed in P4.  Each P4 program can name these things as they
 * choose.  The name used in this program for that piece is given in
 * parentheses:
 *
 * + a parser (parserImpl)
 * + a specialized control block intended for verifying checksums
 *   in received headers (verifyChecksum)
 * + ingress match-action pipeline (ingressImpl)
 *
 * Then there is a packet replication engine and packet buffer, which
 * are not P4-programmable.
 *
 * Egress consists of these things, programmed in P4:
 *
 * + egress match-action pipeline (egressImpl)
 * + a specialized control block intended for computing checksums in
 *   transmitted headers (updateChecksum)
 * + deparser (also called rewrite in some networking chips, deparserImpl)
